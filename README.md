<div align="center">
  <h3>🎭 Where different people's social needs overlap 🎭</h3>
  <p><em>Built for HuddleHive Hack 2025</em></p>
</div>

## 🌟 Project Overview

vennU is a location-based social app that connects people based on their current social/emotional needs for spontaneous 15-60 minute micro-meetups in public spaces. Think of it as "Mood Charades" in real life - instead of acting out words, you're expressing your current social vibe, and others choose to join you if they match your energy.

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

- People crave spontaneous social connection but hate planning/committing to events
- Existing apps require advance scheduling or are dating-focused
- Third spaces (parks, cafes, plazas) are underutilized for community building
- Bad planners and busy people miss out on social opportunities
- Post-work decompression often happens alone when people would prefer gentle company

## 💡 Our Solution

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The **Venn diagram** logo represents our core concept: finding the intersection where different people's social needs overlap. The "U" at the center represents the individual user whose unique needs are valid and worth matching.

### Visual Identity
- **Colors**: Purple-to-teal gradient representing the spectrum of human social needs
- **Typography**: Inter font for modern, accessible readability
- **Interactions**: Smooth animations and transitions for delightful UX
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

vennU aims to:
- Revitalize third spaces as community hubs
- Reduce urban loneliness through accessible connection
- Create new model for spontaneous community building
- Address gap between dating apps and formal meetups
- Serve the "bad planner" demographic

## 🎭 The "Mood Charades" Concept

Traditional charades: Act out a word, others guess what it is.
**vennU Charades**: Express your social vibe, others decide if they match your energy.

This gamification makes social connection feel playful rather than pressured.
